# AgileLife
AgileLife is a new way to run your life and save time. Influenced by ideas and practices of Agile methodology, this application helps track your time and schedule in terms of stories and points. A story is essentially a "task" you have to do, while points are generic measurements of effort usually roughly equating to a measurement of time. There is no hard timeline or dates except within Sprints which are variable periods ranging from 1 week to a month. It sounds crazy  and hard to manage, but it's not. With this, you can push against the hard timelines that one often associates with a strict time-based calendar and achieve success and adaptability.

# Note
The graphical interface is still incomplete, and the algorithm may need to be refactored at some point. Do not expect a complete project.
